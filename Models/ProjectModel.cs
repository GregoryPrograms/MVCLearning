//TODO: Make it so a list of projects is pulled from github in an efficient, low resource manner. Possible that this would be fine to call whenever the site is refreshed - since the # of projects would be low, overhead should be reasonable. 
// Looks like the best way to do this would be using sessionStorage from html5.
public class projects
{  
  public projects()
    {
        //Will add code here to pull projects from github. Will add a way to search through github for projects flagged as viable projects, then construct the class object from information about each project - which will then be used to translate to CSS.
    }
